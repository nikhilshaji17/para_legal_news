# Introduction to UAE Corporate Tax Law
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has introduced a Corporate Tax Law, marking a significant development in the country's taxation regime. This law aims to support small businesses and startups while ensuring that large multinational companies contribute fairly to the economy. The key aspects of this law are outlined in the following sections.

## Corporate Tax Rates
The UAE Corporate Tax Law imposes a standard statutory tax rate of 9% on taxable profits. However, to support small businesses and startups, a 0% tax rate is applicable for taxable profits up to AED 375,000. This incentive is designed to foster growth and innovation among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the UAE. For more information, please refer to the [Ministry of Finance](https://mof.gov.ae/the-ministry-of-finance-announces-the-introduction-of-a-corporate-tax-in-the-uae/) announcement dated 2023.

## Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (DMTT)
In addition to the corporate tax, the UAE will impose a Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (DMTT) of 15% on large multinational companies operating in the country, effective from January 1, 2024. This measure is intended to ensure that these companies pay a minimum level of tax in the UAE, aligning with international tax standards. Further details on the DMTT can be found in the [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/uae-impose-15-domestic-minimum-top-up-tax-large-multinationals-jan-1-2024-12-09/) article published on December 9, 2023.

## Applicability of Corporate Tax
The Corporate Tax will become applicable to businesses in the UAE either on 1 June 2023 or on 1 January 2024, depending on the financial year followed by the business. This flexibility allows companies to adjust their financial planning and compliance accordingly. For guidance on the applicability of corporate tax, please visit the [Official Portal of the UAE Government](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/finance-and-investment/taxation/corporate-tax), updated in 2023.

## Tax Incentives for Growth and Innovation

A key incentive is the 0% tax rate for taxable profits up to AED 375,000, which benefits small businesses and startups. This provision aims to encourage entrepreneurship and the development of new industries in the UAE.
